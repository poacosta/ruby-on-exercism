# Ruby rocks

[Exercism](https://exercism.org/) is an open source, not-for-profit project built by people from all backgrounds. With over one hundred dedicated maintainers and thousands of contributors, our goal is to create the best, free, code learning platform on the web.

**This repo contains my progress in the [Ruby track](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby) on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).**

**I strongly encourage everyone to find their solutions. However, if you're just learning and need a hint, this might help.**

By the way, Exercism frequently updates its exercises. These solutions cover the tests you might find in the folders for this project.

Here's my [public profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/poacosta)

## About Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

Ruby was created as a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

He has often said that he is "trying to make Ruby natural, not simple," in a way that mirrors life.

Building on this, he adds: "Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body."
